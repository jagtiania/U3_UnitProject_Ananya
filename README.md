# u3_unitproject_Ananya

Description: In this project, I am using the function leap motion because I find it really interesting how you can code something and at the same time use your body to make something. I will have poeple move their hands in order to make a piece of art. 

<h3>Milestone #1:November 18th, 2016 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>Task</li> I want to make a piece of art using the leap motion function. I want to make the person interact with the leap motion by them moving their hands up and down so that somewhat of a picture is created. My main goal for this point was to have a clear idea of what to use and how leap motion actually works in order to create an effective project.
